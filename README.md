# Opifex 
Opifex aims to provide a MQTT server in Typescript to be used with [Deno](https://deno.land)

Its a work in progress and currently only has memory based persistence.

## Naming
Some MQTT servers have names like:
- [Mosquitto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito) 
- [Mosca](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musca_domestica) 
- [Aedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes)

So to stay with the theme: [Opifex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opifex_(fly))
